# Quarantine
Quarantine is a psuedo-DBMS facility with a fake backend and can't process data as expected. The life of DBMS data is the duration between loading and closing/reloading. There is no web server to store updated data.  

## Description
This project has been made as Assignment 3 of Kshitij Web Development Summer Workshop 2020 and is basically a TA app in which a TA can add and remove students to the subject record.

## Folder Structure
1. The `build` folder contains the code of the built-up project (final rendered code).  
2. The `src` folder contains the entire source code of the project.  
3. The `public` folder contains all public files (index.html).  

## Features
1. Responsive Web Design
2. `Add a student` option to add a new student to the subject state.
3. A delete `X` button to deregister/delete a student.
4. `Add all students to the subject` option to add the students to subject tracking (this option does nothing as of now, just displays an alert).  
5. Simple form validation which shows simple error messages.
